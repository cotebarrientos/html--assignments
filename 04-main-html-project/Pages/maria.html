        <h2>In my spare time I enjoy doing:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Crochet knitting:</strong> It's something I've been doing since I was 10 years old, and my grandmother was who taught me. Nowadays, 
                my house is full of crochets made by me.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Drawing and painting:</strong> When I have time and feel inspired, I like drawing on my tablet or using my pc with a graphic tablet. My favourite software that I enjoy using are the following: <em>Krita, Ibis paint, Affinity Designer, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</em> 
                I also like painting in the traditional way, either with oil paints or acrylics.

                <strong>Making crafts:</strong> In general I'm a very creative person and I enjoy creating things with my hands. I've made different things from jewellery boxes to custom dolls. About custom dolls, I have a <a href="" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> about it with more than 15.000 subscribers.
