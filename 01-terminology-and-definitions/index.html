        <h1>HTML - Terminology & Definitions</h1>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>What do HTML and CSS stand for?
                <p>
                    <strong>HTML</strong> is the <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, whose function is to give structure to web pages. <strong>CSS</strong> is 
                    the acronym for <em>Cascade Styling Sheets</em>, and its function is to style web pages, in other words, it describes how HTML elements 
                    should be displayed on the website. If HTML is the skeleton of the web page, CSS is the skin that covers it.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Would you rather use HTML or CSS, for putting paragraphs of text on a webpage?
                <p>
                    I would definitely use <strong>HTML</strong> for this task, and for this I would use the "<strong>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</strong>" tag.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Would you rather use HTML or CSS, to change the font and background color of a button?
                <p>
                    I would definitely use <strong>CSS</strong> for this task, and for this I would use some <em>class</em> or <em>id</em> to change the 
                    font and background color of the button.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>What is an HTML tag?
                <p>
                    <strong>HTML tags</strong> are like keywords that help the browser to read, format and display the website's content.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What are the three parts of an HTML element? (image from paragraph)
                <p>
                    An <strong>HTML element</strong> is defined by a start tag, content and an end tag. There are also elements without closing tag and no 
                    content (for example the &lt;img&gt; tag), and they are known as empty elements.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
                <p>
                    Its function is to provide information to the web browser about <em>what version of HTML the website was written in</em>, and it is not 
                    an HTML tag.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is the HTML element?
                <p>
                    <strong>HTML elements</strong> are like containers for content. The opening and closing tags of the elements help the browser to 
                    interpret the information contained, in other words, they tell the browser how it should format the content.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is the purpose of the head element?
                <p>
                    The <strong>head element</strong> is a container for metadata, and is placed between the html and body tag. The metadata define the 
                    document title, styles, scripts, character set and other meta information. 
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is the purpose of the body element?
                <p>
                    The <strong>body element</strong> is the container for all renderable aspects of an html document. It contains content such as 
                    paragraphs, images, heading, links, etc.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>How do you create a paragraph in HTML?
                <p>
                    You can create a <strong>paragraph</strong> in html using the <strong>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</strong> tag.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>How do you create a heading in HTML?
                <p>
                    <strong>HTML headings</strong> are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a web page and you can create them using tags from 
                    &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between them?
                <p>
                    In HTML there are 6 levels of headings, and these are the following: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. The <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> is the 
                    most important heading and the <strong>&lt;h6&gt;</strong> defines the least important.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>What element should you use to make text bold and important?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</strong> tag should be used, since it gives importance to the text as well as making it bold.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</strong> tag should be used, since it is the element in charge of giving emphasis to the text, as well 
                    as making the text italic.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?
                <p>
                    When we nest elements within other elements, we create <strong>a parent and child relationship</strong> between them. The nested 
                    elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?
                <p>
                    If the elements are nested at the same level, they are considered <strong>siblings</strong>.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>How do you create HTML comments?
                <p>
                    You can create HTML comments using the "&lt;! ╌ ╌&gt;" tags. Comments are not rendered by the web browser.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</strong> tag is used to create an unordered list.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</strong> tag is used to create an ordered list.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists?
                <p>
                    The tag used for both ordered and unordered lists is the <strong>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</strong> tag.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>What element is used to create a link?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</strong> tag or <strong>anchor element</strong> is used to create links in HTML.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is an attribute?
                <p>
                    The <strong>attribute</strong> on an HTML element provides additional information about the elements and this is always specified at the 
                    start of the tag.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What attribute tells links where to go?
                <p>
                    The <strong>“href”</strong> attribute is responsible for telling where to go to the link.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?
                <p>
                    <strong>Absolute links</strong> are those that go to other websites on the Internet, while <strong>relative links</strong> are those 
                    that are found on other pages within the same website. <strong>Absolute links</strong> always contain the protocol and the destination 
                    domain, whereas <strong>relative links</strong> don't need to include the domain name.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Which element is used to display an image?
                <p>
                    The <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag is used to render images on a website.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li>What two attributes do images always need to have?
                <p>The 2 attributes that an <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag should have are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>src:</strong> tells the browser where the image is located, works very similar to the “href” attribute.</li>
                    <li><strong>alt:</strong> is used to describe an image or when an image cannot be loaded.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            </li>
                	
            <li>How do you access a parent directory in a file path?
                <p>
                    A path describes the location of a file in the folder structure of a Web site. You can access directories using <strong>"/"</strong> or 
                    <strong>".."</strong>, depending on the case. Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <table border='1'>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>PATH</th>
                            <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;img src=”my-pic.jpg”&gt;</td>
                            <td>The file is located in the same folder as the current page.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;img src=”img/my-pic.jpg”&gt;</td>
                            <td>The file is located in the img folder in the current folder.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;img src=”/img/my-pic.jpg”&gt;</td>
                            <td>The file is located in the img folder at the root of the current web.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>&lt;img src=”../my-pic.jpg”&gt;</td>
                            <td>The file is located in the img folder one level up from the current folder.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <br>
            </li>
                
            <li>What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?
                <p>
                    The 4 image formats used on the web are the following: <strong>JPG, PNG, SVG</strong> and <strong>GIF</strong>.
                </p>
